A data-driven exploration of unmet health care needs in Canada, focusing on age groups, gender differences, regional variations, and changes over time (2018–2023).

📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes publicly available Canadian health data to understand how different populations experience access to health care. The dataset includes:

Age groups (15–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65+)

Gender (Male, Female)

Indicators (unmet health care needs, primary care access, same-day appointments, wait-time satisfaction, etc.)

Values reported as percentages

Years: 2018–2023

The objective is to identify patterns, inequities, and trends that highlight where health care gaps persist.

🧠 Key Insights

Younger adults (especially 25–34 and 35–44) report the highest levels of unmet health needs.

Older adults (65+) consistently show lower unmet needs, possibly due to stable access to primary care.

Gender differences are visible, with women often reporting slightly higher unmet needs.

Some indicators improved post-pandemic, while others show continued strain in the system.

Regional disparities suggest variability in accessibility and health system performance across provinces.

📊 Methods
